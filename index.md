I like challenges, this is what keeps me going. For me there are no problems only puzzles in life and I enjoy solving them. I like to try new things, sometimes it goes for me sometimes against me. I count age with experiences not in numbers. Being a coder I always try to fix bugs in life.  
I believe that code written should be open for scaling but close for modification.
